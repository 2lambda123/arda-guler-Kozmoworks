Astrodynamics software, to-be successor of [OrbitSim3D](https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D), with similar features but faster computations. 
This version currently **supports n-body problems** with **impulsive** or **finite-burn orbital maneuvering**. It features a **1st order** and an **8th order orbit propagator**.

Mission scenarios are defined in .json files - see scenarios/test.json for an example.

This is still a Work-In-Progress (TM) - many features are missing but intended for implementation:

- Atmospheric drag
- Radiation pressure
- Spherical harmonics gravity
- ...
